## <a id='exe_summary'></a>Executive Summary

VMware Tanzu Architecture for Dell EMC VxRail (TA4V) is an integrated environment built on [hyperconverged](https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/converged-infrastructure/hyper-converged-infrastructure.htm) hardware/software infrastructure. It offers you high performance potential, convenience, and it addresses the challenges of creating, testing, and updating applications in a consolidated production environment. This describes a set of validated architectures anyone can adopt to get proven operational benefits. The architectures are organized to provide a pathway for growing your environment from a minimal single cluster system to a multiple cluster architecture.

## <a id='benefits'></a>Key Benefits

TA4V enables you to quickly and reliably create an integrated application deployment platform and provides a variety of platform sizes to meet your needs. It is a validated set of architectures that recommends the scalable, hyper-converged Dell EMC VxRail Appliance along with VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN and NSX-T Data Center products. With TA4V, you can deploy production-ready application container environments quickly and reliably compared to a build-it-yourself approach.

Several application container technologies such as TKGI and TAS, are designed to meet application operational needs. Professional Services engagements from Dell EMC and VMware can help you install and test TA4V in your IT environment. Your IT professionals who are tasked with planning compute, network, and storage capacity can work with Dell EMC Professional Services to determine the requirements for these resources.

TA4V enables developers to quickly publish, run, and scale legacy software, packaged software, and cloud-native applications. The TA4V platform is based on an integrated infrastructure that enables IT operators to easily manage and scale the development environment with tools such as VxRail Manager and Tanzu Operations Manager.

With TA4V, your organization will benefit from:

* Reference architectures for a variety of highly available Tanzu application platforms
* Private cloud and infrastructure services with simplified deployment
* Highly available platforms on which to develop and quickly deploy applications, and which reduce application delivery times
* Modern developer platforms that boost developer productivity by combining application services, service discovery, container management, and orchestration within an ecosystem of developer tool plug-ins
* Consistent cloud solutions, providing increased reliability, portability, and agility
* Lifecycle management from the lowest level hardware system firmware to the highest level of application container deployment system of choice

### Validated Versions And Interoperability For This Release

This recommended architecture includes VMware vSphere and NSX-T Data Center, a software-defined network virtualization technology that runs on VMware ESXi hosts and combines routing, firewalling, NAT/SNAT, and load balancing. It also includes an application container layer from several choices available in the VMware Tanzu portfolio.
