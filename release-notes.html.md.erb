- NSX-T 3.0.2 now supports an "extra-large" edge vm size, which can improve transactional throughput of TKGI cluster & TAS foundation loadbalancers.  For more information, see [NSX Edge VM System Requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/installation/GUID-22F87CA8-01A9-4F2E-B7DB-9350CA60EA4E.html)
- NSX-T 3.0.x supports Converged Virtual Distributed Switch (C-VDS) for host transport zone attachment.  This allows for deployment of hardware using 2-nic design instead of 4-nic.  Validations of this release were performed using this design.
- No upgrade validation has been performed with this release due to the above C-VDS design change; there is no upgrade path for platforms deployed with previous n-VDS (4-nic) designs.
